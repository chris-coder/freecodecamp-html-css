        <li>
          Thanos was one of the last sons of A'Lars, progenitor of the second
          colony of Eternals on Titan, and Sui-San, the last survivor of the
          original settlement of Eternals in this moon.
        </li>

        <li>
          He was born with purple, hide-like skin and a massive body due to his
          Deviant Syndrome.
        </li>

        <li>
          By the time he was a teenager, Thanos excelled academically and
          learned faster than he was taught.
        </li>

        <li>
          Thanos experimented on his own body, granting himself a variety of
          powers. Thanos' confidante became his companion, and eventually
          declared that for her to love Thanos, he would have to become a god, a
          supreme destroyer above all else.
        </li>

        <li>
          Thanos soon formulated a plan to regain Death's affection: he would
          give to "her" more than any single living being had given "her," the
          annihilation of everything that lives.
